# Using the scripts to manage your OpenLattice local stack

## Pre-requisites 
Please make sure you have docker ce, elasticsearch 7.4+, java 11 installed. 

The scripts is currently configured to use citus 9.2. If you want to update the version, update the citus.yaml file following instructions at http://docs.citusdata.com/en/v9.2/installation/single_machine_docker.html[http://docs.citusdata.com/en/v9.2/installation/single_machine_docker.html]

## Seeding your database for the first time
Seeding your database will automatically setup your citus cluster to have a distributed database called openlattice as well as configure elasticsearch to support a sufficient number of shards for indexing.

```
./ol_init.sh
```

## Re-seeding your database 

**Warning this will wipe all your existing data and indices**

```
./ol_init.sh wipe
```
